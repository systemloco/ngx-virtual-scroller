# v13.3.2

* @systemloco added Angular 13.3.2 support

# v13.2.7

* @systemloco added Angular 13.2.7 support

# v3.0.1

* Use new Angular8 syntax for ViewChild/ContentChild (https://angular.io/guide/static-query-migration)

# v3.0.0

* If items array is prepended with additional items, keep scroll on currently visible items, if possible.
* Removed ChangeEvent (replaced by IPageInfo)
* Removed several deprecated properties (ChangeEvent.start, ChangeEvent.end, update/change/start/end events [renamed to vsUpdate/vsChange/vsStart/vsEnd])
* Auto-refresh improvement: During ngDoCheck, evaluates if javascript objects associated with any currently visible items have been replaced with different objects (for example: items array has been sorted, but still has the same items & length).

# v2.1.0

* Syntax of Dependency Injection changed

# v2.0.9

* Include margin in calculations for element size to improve smoothness of scrolling

# v2.0.7

* Add "sideEffects": true flag to package.json to prevent advanced optimizations which were causing runtime exceptions (due to get/set properties not being 'pure').

# v2.0.6

* Use ng-packagr to properly format npm publish for Angular consumption (Ivy support)

# v2.0.3

* Switch to ES2015 Module (instead of CommonJS) to support Ivy.

# v2.0.2

* Bug fix to sticky header with parentScroll

# v1.0.15

# v1.0.11

* Fix issue #258

# v1.0.10

* Refactor of speed improvement flag (renamed to executeRefreshOutsideAngularZone). With instructions & warning.

# v1.0.9

* Add flag to enable speed improvement from v1.0.8 (because it causes issues with `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`.

# v1.0.8

* Speed improvement. Thanks to sharikovvladislav & nickbullock !

# v1.0.7

* Fix bug where viewportItems had an extra row of invisible items outside viewport (also affected vsStart/vsEnd/vsChange.endIndex)

# v1.0.6

* Add new properties to vsStart/vsEnd/vsChange events. Remove viewPortIndices property, because it's been replaced by viewPortInfo.

# v1.0.5

* Support for fixed <thead> on <table> tags.

# v1.0.4

* Add ScrollDebounceTime

# v1.0.3

* Rename everything from virtual-scroll to virtual-scroller and from virtualScroll to virtualScroller

* Improve AngularUniversal/SSR support

# v1.0.1

* Renamed from angular2-virtual-scroll to ngx-virtual-scroller

# v0.4.15

# v0.4.14

* Fix regression 'TypeError: Cannot read property 'sumOfKnownWrapGroupChildWidths' of undefined'

# v0.4.13

* Support for dependency injection of some configuration properties
* New APIs: scrollToPosition, invalidateAllCachedMeasurements, invalidateCachedMeasurementForItem, invalidateCachedMeasurementAtIndex, viewPortInfo
* ScrollStartPosition, ScrollEndPosition, MaxScrollPosition properties added to ChangeEvent

# v0.4.12

* viewPortIndices.arrayStartIndex renamed to viewPortIndices.startIndex and viewPortIndices.arrayEndIndex renamed to viewPortIndices.endIndex
* Fix scrollbar measurements (horizontal/vertical calculations were backwards)
* After component is removed it reverts css overflow-x/overflow-y of parentScroll back to their original values.
* Previously, if scroll parent was resized it would automatically call Refresh. This still occurs, except if new size is 0.
* Breaking Change: The start and end values of the change/start/end events were including bufferAmount, which made them confusing. This has been corrected.

# v0.4.11

* Bug fix to items array modifications with "enableUnequalChildrenSizes" which caused non-modified items to have to be re-measured.

# v0.4.10

* Minor bug fixes.
* Prevent delay if scrollThrottlingTime is set to 0.
* Fix bug where children would not be re-measured if their original measurement was 0 (due to elements still initializing)
* Add vs* prefix to event names to prevent conflicts with native DOM events, example: <virtual-scroller (vsChange)=""><input (change)="" /></virtual-scroller>

# v0.4.9

* Default scrollThrottlingTime to 0.

# v0.4.8

* Improvements to "enableUnequalChildrenSizes". Thanks to Pavel Kukushkin (kykint) for Pull-Request.
* Add scrollThrottlingTime parameter for performance reasons.
* Use style box-sizing: border-box on child elements of viewport to enable padding/border to be taken into account when calculating sizes.

# v0.4.7

* useMarginInsteadOfTranslate flag. Defaults to false. This can affect performance (better/worse depending on your circumstances), and also creates a workaround for the transform+position:fixed browser bug.

# v0.4.6

* Update Readme

# v0.4.5

* Update Readme

# v0.4.4

* Added ability to use virtual scroll with different sized of elements
* flag "enableUnequalChildrenSizes" was added (defaults to false) to bypass the different-height elements calculations (for users with fixed-height children to avoid the minor performance impact).
Breaking Change: The value of ChangeEvent.end wasn't intuitive. This has been corrected. Both ChangeEvent.start and ChangeEvent.end are the 0-based array indexes of the items being rendered in the viewport. (Previously Change.End was the array index + 1)

# v0.3.4

* revert package.json to Angular 4 instead of Angular 6 since they should be backwards compatible

# v0.3.3
